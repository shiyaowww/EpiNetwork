Updates:

4 levels of disparity in susceptibility added.

4 x 7 x 2 scenarios in total. (5 hr 49 min on greatlakes)

Overall and by-group risks are of interest.

RR will be the measure of social disparity in terms of disease burden.

To be improved:

100% nodematch command

re-parametrization towards more realistic curves

risk or risk ratio plots: 3d scatter or contour, over nodematching-susceptibility

standardized index variable names
