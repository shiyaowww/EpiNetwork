Population scaled up to 1000 nodes.
Lower beta: 0.4
Higher contacts: mean degree = 2
Gamma 0.16, assuming 6 month's duration.
i.num; i.num.ses1; i.num.ses0; risk(incidence) by group; relative risk are plotted.

The only difference across scenarios is the assortative mixing level. 
No nodewise variation in susceptibility included yet.
