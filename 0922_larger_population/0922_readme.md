Population scaled up to 1000 nodes.

Lower beta: 0.4

Higher contacts: mean degree = 2

Gamma 0.16, assuming 6 month's duration.

i.num; i.num.ses1; i.num.ses0; risk(incidence) by group; relative risk are plotted.

The only difference across scenarios is the assortative mixing level. 
No nodewise variation in susceptibility included yet.

***Technical problemï¼š
Within iterations after plotting sim, ggplot doesn't output the last two plots.
But when I do cmd+Enter manually step by step, the plots are displayed.
Sill trying to figure out why.
