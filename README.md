# EpiNetwork
To understand the joint impact of contact networks and susceptibility on the burden of infectious diseases.

We look at outbreak patterns in the general population, as well as disparities between groups regarding social determinants.

Primary research question focuses on the effects and the effect modification(interaction) of (1)contact clustering in the network and (2)individual susceptibility to infection, two mediators on two different pathways leading from (3)social determinants(SES for example) to (4)the outcome of disease on a DAG. 

So to begin with, we make nodematch level(an edgewise feature) and susceptibility(a nodewise feature) the only changing variables, controlling for all the other factors.

Later on we might apply different durations for edges with different nature(nodematched vs. cross-group) as an auxiliary question. For me at this moment, making edge duration heterogeneous requires further knowledge of formation function in EpiModel.
