I sort of think that network construct alone does affect endemic level and it's not a bug that we observe different endemics for different levels of assortative mixing.

This experiment is done based on my guess above. 

I created 3 extreme constructs of network, for each of which: 

n=500;
no difference of susceptibility for each node;
overall mean degree held at 1.

It turns out that the endemic levels do differ across scenarios.
