I chose 12% and 30% as the proportion of disadvantaged group.

For both porportions, assortative mixing level of 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% were explored.

For each of the 10 scenarios above, netest diagnostics, a network snapshot and summary plots of i.num and s.num are recorded.

There seems an increasing trend of endemic level as the nodematch level increases. 
But I'm not sure is it the case or simply produced by modeling issue.
